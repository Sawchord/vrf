# VRF

:warning: This Library is currently a proof of concept. It has not been audited, nor am I currently planing to develop this into a production ready library. Use at your own risk! :warning:

This is a (partially) [RFC9381](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9381.html) compliant implementation of a verifiable random function.
In particular, currently only the `ECVRF-EDWARDS25519-SHA512-TAI` ciphersuite is implemented.
